## Weekly Responses

### Summary
This week was essentially an introduction into animating a P5.JS sketch. The main aspects of the week revolved around creating a drawing loop with a frame rate and understanding how the animation takes place.

### Steps
This week I found myself watching several Dan Shiffman videos as he breaks down and explains what each piece of code means. I spent a lot of time watching the rotation and animation videos. I worked my way through the sketch by moving in order of operations and push and pop. I learned the importance of breaking up code in sections.

### Issues
I struggled a bit with width and height, the math portion always trips me up. Working with the same canvas size gave me a chance to start to understand where everything is in relation. I did not use the issues forum this week and mostly used trial and error. I googled a lot of my questions.

## Future Weeks
I still feel a bit shaky on successfully and quickly animating something. This week took me 7 hours to complete. Hopefully with practice, I will reach a confident level.
