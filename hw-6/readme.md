## Weekly Responses

### Summary
This week we learned about the mathematic side of P5.JS. We discovered several math functions and operations that create what is known as Algorithmic art. These sketches utilize algebra, for example a coder integrates addition, subtraction, etc. to create movement on a canvas. There are special rules to remember when working with math in the P5.js software.

### Steps
To complete this week, I had to review and break down each of the fucntions or operations I tried to use. I had to review the examples and reference book to see how they affected code and where they should be used to create a draw loop. I worked out each aspect of my sketch one at a time, adding the things we learned this week very slowly and carefully.

### Issues
My biggest issue was making sure a mistake, miscalculation or misunderstanding didn't destroy/break my entire code. I have struggled very hard with the past few weeks so my design is not very complex. I made sure to complete each of the criteria required in this lesson which was difficult for me last week.

### Future Weeks
This week took me five hours to complete. That is less then last week so I am hoping that I am slowly but surely catching on. I feel as though I am having trouble keeping up. Next week explore program flow which I have no knowledge on.
